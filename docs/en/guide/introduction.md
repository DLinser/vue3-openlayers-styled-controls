# Introduction

`vue3-openlayers-styled-controls` is a customizable styled map controls library based on Vue 3 and OpenLayers. It aims to solve the problem of single styling of native OpenLayers controls and the difficulty of integrating with modern front-end frameworks (such as Vue).

## Why vue3-openlayers-styled-controls?

Native OpenLayers controls have the following limitations:

- Lack of modern UI design
- Difficult to integrate with project design systems
- Poor mobile experience
- Limited customization options

This library provides a solution by offering:

- Beautiful, responsive controls with customizable themes
- Deep Vue 3 integration using Composition API
- Complete TypeScript support
- Built-in internationalization (i18n) support
- Lightweight and focused on map controls enhancement

## Core Concepts

The library is built around several key concepts:

1. **Component-based Architecture**: Each control is a standalone Vue component that can be imported and used independently.

2. **Theming**: All controls support SCSS-based theming through CSS variables, making it easy to customize the appearance to match your brand.

3. **Composition API**: Controls are built using Vue 3's Composition API for better code organization and reusability.

4. **Internationalization**: Built-in i18n support with English and Chinese out of the box, and easy extension for additional languages.

5. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript definitions for all components and APIs.
